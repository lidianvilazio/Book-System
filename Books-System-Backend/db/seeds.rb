# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

user1 = User.create({name: 'user1', username: 'username1', password: '12345'})

# book1 = Book.create({author: 'author1', title: 'Book1'})
Book.createBook

# relation1 = UserBook.create({user: user1, book: book1})
